<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS Image Sensor for Vehicle-Mounted Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front-illuminated (FSI) CMOS Sensor</li><li>Backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CMOS Image Sensor market for vehicle-mounted cameras includes two main types: Front-illuminated (FSI) and Backside-illuminated (BSI) sensors. FSI sensors capture images using a structure where the photodiodes are placed in front of the circuitry, resulting in reduced light sensitivity and performance in low-light conditions. In contrast, BSI sensors position the circuitry behind the photodiodes, enhancing light collection and improving image quality, particularly in low-light environments. This differentiation is crucial for advanced vehicular applications like night vision and autonomous driving.</p></p>
